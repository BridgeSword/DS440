Human Activity Recognition Platform Using Wearable Sensors
Introduction

This project aims to develop an innovative and efficient platform for human activity recognition (HAR) using advanced machine learning methods (LSTM, CNN) and real-time sensor data collected from wearable devices. It features a user-friendly frontend dashboard providing personalized activity insights and recommendations.
Features

    Real-time Activity Tracking: Upload daily activity data (e.g., steps, sitting, walking, sleeping duration) via mobile devices.
    Intelligent Analysis: Calculates basal metabolic rate (BMR) and provides health recommendations based on user activity patterns.
    Interactive Dashboard: Clear visualization and summary of daily activities and personalized advice.

Technical Stack

    Frontend: React.js
    Backend: Python (Flask)
    Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM, CNN)
    Database: SQLite
    Deployment: Docker (optional)
